# What is this? #

The Star Rating Plugin is a plugin for the jQuery Javascript library that creates a non-obstrusive star rating control based on a set of radio input boxes.

# What does it do? #

# It turns a collection of radio boxes into a neat star-rating control.

# It creates the interface based on standard form elements, which means the basic functionality will still be available even if Javascript is disabled.

# NEW (12-Mar-08): In read only mode (using the 'readOnly' option or disabled property), the plugin is a neat way of displaying star-like values without any additional code
